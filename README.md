# 🧬 Nature’s Binary Atlas

**What if carbon had a code? What if nature already speaks in binary?**  
A project by **Symbuilt** and collaborators.

Nature’s Binary Atlas (NBA) is a scientific, symbolic interface that bridges carbon, code, and consciousness. Explore the language of life through:

- ✳️ **Carbon glyphs encoded in binary**
- ⚛️ **Real molecular structures (e.g. protein 2J4W)**
- 🧠 **Interactive glyph canvas and annotation tools**

## 🔬 Features

- 🧩 **Draw Binary Glyphs** – 10x10 grid canvas for carbon symbolism  
- 💾 **Save with Metadata** – title, annotation, tags, and structure links  
- 🧬 **3D Molecular Viewer** – visualize real-world proteins using [3Dmol.js](https://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/)  
- 🧠 **Local Exploration** – store and browse your carbon-coded ideas  
- 📤 **Future Exports** – coming soon: JSON, posters, shared glyph database

## 🧭 Vision

**Nature’s Binary Atlas** is part of a greater mission by [Symbuilt](https://github.com/symbuilt) to explore sustainable technology, symbolism, and science.  
We believe carbon isn’t just a threat — it’s a thread. A carrier of memory, potential, and meaning.
