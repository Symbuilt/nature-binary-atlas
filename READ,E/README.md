# 🧬 Nature’s Binary Atlas (NBA) — 3D Molecular Viewer Prototype

**Nature’s Binary Atlas** is an experimental interface for exploring biological data through symbolic carbon glyphs, binary encodings, and molecular structure visualization.

🌱 _“Carbon is forever — but we can use it to understand DNA, signal patterns, and harvest energy.”_

## 📦 Features in this Prototype
- 🌐 Visualizes a real **PDB molecular structure** (`2J4W`)
- ✳️ Shows **binary and carbon glyph encodings**
- 🧬 Uses [3Dmol.js](https://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/) for high-quality 3D models

---

## 🔧 Roadmap
- ✏️ Interactive carbon glyph **drawing canvas**
- 💾 Metadata form to **save custom glyphs**
- 🔍 Search and filter across entries
- 🔗 Live links to real **PDB files**
- ⚙️ Export glyphs and metadata to file or database

---

## 📚 Credits
- Viewer powered by [3Dmol.js](https://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/)
- Design and research by Symbuilt, 2025
